## Purpose

Our community is committed to the provision of a welcoming and harassment-free experience for all participants, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or any other personal characteristic. Harassment in any form will not be tolerated. The use of sexual language and imagery is deemed inappropriate in any context associated with this event or community. Individuals found violating these guidelines may be subject to sanctions or expulsion from the event or community, at the sole discretion of the organising body, without entitlement to a refund.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all event spaces—both physical and online—related to the event, including but not limited to: talks, workshops, 
community spaces, social media, and all modes of communication.

Organisers will enforce this Code throughout the event.

## Our Standards

### Anti-Harassment Policy

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
  - Verbal or written comments that reinforce social hierarchies related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.
  - Display of sexual images in public spaces.
  - Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.
  - Harassing photography or recording.
  - Sustained disruption of talks or events.
  - Inappropriate or unwanted physical contact.
  - Unwelcome sexual attention.
  - Advocacy for or encouragement of any prohibited behaviors described above.

### Ableism

Ableist language, including but not limited to terms such as “crazy,” “dumb,” “insane,” or “lame,” should be avoided as it marginalises those with different physical or mental abilities. More precise and respectful language is encouraged.

> [!NOTE]
> To find out more about ableism and replacement terms please read [this guide](https://www.autistichoya.com/p/ableist-words-and-terms-to-avoid.html).
>

### Sexism

Any form of sexism or derogatory language is forbidden. Please refrain from using gendered terms—for example, addressing mixed-gender groups as “guys” or “dudes”—as these can perpetuate exclusion. Gender-neutral language should be used at all times.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information please familiarise yourself with the [Geek Feminism wiki guide](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Nonsexist_language).
>

### Excpected Behaviour

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:
  - Being open: Eagerly collaborating regardless of background, and encouraging diverse perspectives.
  - Being considerate: Acknowledging and appreciating the efforts of fellow community members and volunteers.
  - Being respectful: Listening to differing viewpoints, accepting constructive criticism gracefully, and addressing disagreements courteously.
  - Demonstrating empathy: Showing patience, understanding, and kindness to all participants.
  - Using welcoming and inclusive language: Avoiding exclusionary jokes, slurs, or stereotypes.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you or someone else feels unsafe or unwelcome, please notify event organisers or community leaders at the earliest opportunity. Reports can be made personally or anonymously using [`INCLUDE REPORT LINK`], and all concerns will be addressed discreetly and respectfully. Organisers and designated responders will be clearly identified and trained in receiving reports.

> [!NOTE]
> It is a good idea to have someone external to the organisers for code of conduct report enforcement as well.
>
> See Example Below...
>

If the report involves one of the organisers, then you can submit a Code of Conduct report to our third-party Code of Conduct representative, that is external to the event organisers: [`EXTERNAL CoC REPRESENTATIVE EMAIL ADDRESS`].

### Anonymous Reports

Anonymous reports can be submitted via the official channel provided. While direct follow-up may not be possible, all reports will be investigated thoroughly, and appropriate action will be pursued.

### Emergency Services

In circumstances where an individual’s immediate health, safety, or wellbeing is at risk, community members and event staff are expected to act promptly and responsibly.

You should contact local emergency services (police, ambulance, or fire) without delay in the following situations:
  - There is a credible threat of violence, harm, or imminent danger to any person
  - Someone is experiencing a medical emergency requiring urgent professional assistance
  - You witness or are informed of sexual assault or any form of violence
  - Situations involving loss of consciousness, severe injury, or medical distress that cannot be safely managed by onsite staff

> [!NOTE]
> It is a good idea to train organisers in first-aid and have established emergency procedures.
>

Organisers and team members are trained to facilitate these calls if needed. Once emergency services are contacted, please also notify a community organiser or team member as soon as it is safe to do so.

## Enforcement

Individuals asked to cease any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Failure to do so may result in removal from the event or community, at the discretion of the organisers. Organisers reserve the right to take action to preserve the event’s safe and welcoming environment, up to and including expulsion without refund or restriction from future participation.

These standards apply at all event venues, related social activities, and in all interactions, including online and on social media.
